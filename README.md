<div align="center"><h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raj Yeola</h1></div>
<div align="center"><h3>Frontend Engineer</h3></div>



I have 2+ years of experience engineering frontend solutions that are responsive, maintainable and built to scale.

My journey began during my graduation, when I interned at MadScientist, a social media platform as a Frontend Developer Intern. There, I collaborated closely with the product and design teams to design, develop, and test UI components. I mainly worked on Redux-based CRUD features, gaining hands-on experience with building user-centric flows in a fast-paced startup environment.

After graduating, I joined QuickSell, where Iâ€™ve worked across both their products â€” QuickSell and DoubleTick CRM.
â€¢ On DoubleTick CRM, Iâ€™ve led and contributed to several major features and enhancements:
 â—¦ Built Excel import with auto-mapping, made improvements to a Chrome Extension, and enhanced the React Flowâ€“based bot builder for automation use cases.
 â—¦ Implemented advanced customer filters with nesting, real-time updates using sockets, and features like private notes with @mentions, payment add-ons, FBM verification, etc.
 â—¦ Developed iframe-based routing, enabling embedded usage within external platforms, with dynamic UI toggling via query params - used seamlessly across iOS, Android, and Web.
 â—¦ Optimised API usage patterns, helping reduce infrastructure costs.
 â—¦ Resolved customer-reported Zoho Desk tickets, often coordinating directly with users and jumping on calls to resolve critical issues efficiently.
 â—¦ Contributed to DoubleTickâ€™s public website, focusing on UI polish, smooth animations, and an attractive, modern interface.
â€¢ On the QuickSell product, I worked within a legacy React (class components) codebase - delivering a platform-wide iframe (webview) used across Android, iOS, and Web to enable barcode-based order-taking. I also contributed various smaller features and bug fixes, sharpening my troubleshooting and backward-compatibility skills.

Beyond code, Iâ€™ve taken interviews, mentored junior devs, and helped shape hiring decisions - experiences that have made me a better engineer and communicator.

Tech stack: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, SCSS, Jotai, Redux, and hands-on experience with CDNs, caching strategies, deployments, and maintaining legacy systems.
